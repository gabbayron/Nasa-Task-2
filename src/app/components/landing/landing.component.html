        One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day. In fact, this website is one of
        the most popular websites across all federal agencies. It has the popular appeal of a Justin Bieber video. This
        endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other
        applications. In addition, if the concept_tags parameter is set to True, then keywords derived from the image
        explanation are returned. These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram
        feeds; but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery. </h3>
